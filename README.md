### :cherries: Sponsorship and prioritized development :cherries:
Peaqev is developed without static funding. If you lack your locale/charger type or have wishes for other specific features that you would like to see prioritized, please consider becoming a [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/elden1337) to bump your desired changes in my backlog.
- In order to flag a ticket, either create a new one or comment on an existing one after you've started your sponsorship. I will then flag the ticket with `sponsored-change` and try to prioritize this going forward
- Becoming a sponsor is not a guarantee that a wish will be created, or a guarantee for a specified resolution time. Peaqev is being developed in my spare time and every feature has to be considered by me before taking it into development
- I may need to reach out for testing, especially if your wish includes implementing new charger types
- Critical bugs discovered of course always triages higher than features
